# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard  | Starbucks-Inspired Design)

A clean, insight-focused **Excel dashboard** built to analyze coffee sales performance and support loyalty program and inventory decisions using simple, clutter-free visuals.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Coffee Sales Dashboard** was created to help a business owner track sales performance and design a data-driven **loyalty program**. While raw sales and customer data were available, comparing different coffee beans and roast types over time — and linking sales data with customer behavior — was time-consuming and complex.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

The business owner faced three key challenges:

* Comparing sales performance across **different coffee beans and roast types** was slow and inefficient
* Analyzing **time-based trends** (daily, monthly, seasonal) required manual effort
* Relating **sales data with customer data** to identify regular customers for a loyalty program was complex

Without a consolidated dashboard, decision-making around customer rewards, inventory planning, and cost control was inefficient.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To design a **simple and effective Excel dashboard** that:

* Enables quick comparison of coffee beans and roast types
* Allows time-based analysis using interactive filters
* Establishes a clear relationship between **sales and customer data**
* Supports loyalty program decisions by identifying regular customers
* Helps optimize inventory and reduce unnecessary costs
